The primary objective of this project is to employ cutting-edge data analytics methodologies to address key challenges in the banking industry. The focus areas include:

1. *Customer Segmentation (Clustering):*
   - Utilize sophisticated clustering algorithms to group customers based on their banking behaviors, transaction histories, and demographics.
   
2. *Credit Risk Assessment (Classification):*
   - Develop a robust credit scoring system employing classification algorithms to assess the creditworthiness of loan applicants.
   - Utilize historical data to train the model and predict the likelihood of default or late payments.
   - Enhance risk management by seamlessly integrating machine learning models into the credit approval process.

3. *Performance Prediction (Regression):*
   - Build robust regression models to predict key performance indicators (KPIs) for the banking institution, such as asset growth, revenue, and profitability.
   - Analyze the impact of various factors, including economic indicators and market trends, on the bank's performance.
   - Provide actionable insights to optimize resource allocation, investment strategies, and overall business performance.
